# Project overview
First project of the course Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning, done with the group 8Pesto. The aim was developing a Convolutional Neural Network to solve a multi-class classification problem. The dataset consisted in RGB images of blood cells belonging to 8 different classes.
This project was organized as a competition on Codabench and the final model was evaluated using a secret test set.
